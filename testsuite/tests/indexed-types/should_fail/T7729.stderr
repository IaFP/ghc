      Expected type: t0 (BasePrimMonad m) a -> Rand m a
        Actual type: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a -> Rand m a
      The type variable ‘t0’ is ambiguous
    • In the first argument of ‘(.)’, namely ‘liftPrim’
      In the expression: liftPrim . lift
      In an equation for ‘liftPrim’: liftPrim = liftPrim . lift
    • Relevant bindings include
