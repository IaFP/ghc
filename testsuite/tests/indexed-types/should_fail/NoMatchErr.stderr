    • Could not deduce: Memo d0 ~ Memo d
      from the context: (Memo d @@ a, Fun d)
        bound by the type signature for:
                   f :: forall d a. (Memo d @@ a, Fun d) => Memo d a -> Memo d a
        at NoMatchErr.hs:19:7-37
      Expected type: Memo d a -> Memo d a
        Actual type: Memo d0 a -> Memo d0 a
      NB: ‘Memo’ is a non-injective type family
      The type variable ‘d0’ is ambiguous
    • In the ambiguity check for ‘f’
      To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
      In the type signature: f :: (Fun d) => Memo d a -> Memo d a
