drvfail003.hs:16:56: error:
    • Could not deduce (Show (v (v a)))
        arising from the first field of ‘End’ (type ‘v (v a)’)
      from the context: (v @@ a, v @@ v a, w @@ a, w @@ Pair v w a,
                         v @@ Pair v w a)
        bound by the deriving clause for ‘Show (Square_ v w a)’
        at drvfail003.hs:16:56-59
      Possible fix:
        use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
          so you can specify the instance context yourself
    • When deriving the instance for (Show (Square_ v w a))
