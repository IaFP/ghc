drvfail001.hs:16:33: error:
    • Could not deduce (Show (f (f a)))
        arising from the first field of ‘ZeroS’ (type ‘f (f a)’)
      from the context: (f @@ a, f @@ f a, f @@ Cons f a)
        bound by the deriving clause for ‘Show (SM f a)’
        at drvfail001.hs:16:33-36
      Possible fix:
        use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
          so you can specify the instance context yourself
    • When deriving the instance for (Show (SM f a))
