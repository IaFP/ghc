    • Could not deduce (Eq (Process a))
        arising from the first field of ‘Do’ (type ‘Process a’)

      Possible fix:
        use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
          so you can specify the instance context yourself
    • When deriving the instance for (Eq (Continuation a))
