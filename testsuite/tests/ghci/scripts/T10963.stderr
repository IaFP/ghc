<interactive>:1:1: error:
    Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘foo’
    prevents the constraint ‘(Monoid a0)’ from being solved.
    Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
    These potential instances exist:
      instance Monoid a => Monoid (IO a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
      instance Monoid Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
      instance Semigroup a => Monoid (Maybe a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
      ...plus 7 others
      ...plus 21 instances involving out-of-scope types
      (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
