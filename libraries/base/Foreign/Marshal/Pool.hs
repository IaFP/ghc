-- This module contains support for pooled memory management. Under this scheme,
-- (re-)allocations belong to a given pool, and everything in a pool is
-- deallocated when the pool itself is deallocated. This is useful when
-- 'Foreign.Marshal.Alloc.alloca' with its implicit allocation and deallocation
-- is not flexible enough, but explicit uses of 'Foreign.Marshal.Alloc.malloc'
-- and 'free' are too awkward.
