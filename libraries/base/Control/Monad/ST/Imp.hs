{- Note [fixST]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~

For many years, we implemented fixST much like a pure fixpoint,
using liftST:

  fixST :: (a -> ST s a) -> ST s a
  fixST k = ST $ \ s ->
      let ans       = liftST (k r) s
          STret _ r = ans
      in
      case ans of STret s' x -> (# s', x #)

We knew that lazy blackholing could cause the computation to be re-run if the
result was demanded strictly, but we thought that would be okay in the case of
ST. However, that is not the case (see #15349). Notably, the first time
the computation is executed, it may mutate variables that cause it to behave
*differently* the second time it's run. That may allow it to terminate when it
should not. More frighteningly, Arseniy Alekseyev produced a somewhat contrived
example ( https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2018-July/028889.html )
demonstrating that it can break reasonable assumptions in "trustworthy" code,
causing a memory safety violation. So now we implement fixST much like we do
fixIO. See also the implementation notes for fixIO. Simon Marlow wondered
whether we could get away with an IORef instead of an MVar. I believe we
cannot. The function passed to fixST may spark a parallel computation that
demands the final result. Such a computation should block until the final
result is available.
