{- Note [NOINLINE someNatVal]

`someNatVal` converts a natural number to an existentially quantified
dictionary for `KnownNat` (aka `SomeNat`).  The existential quantification
is very important, as it captures the fact that we don't know the type
statically, although we do know that it exists.   Because this type is
fully opaque, we should never be able to prove that it matches anything else.
This is why coherence should still hold:  we can manufacture a `KnownNat k`
dictionary, but it can never be confused with a `KnownNat 33` dictionary,
because we should never be able to prove that `k ~ 33`.

But how to implement `someNatVal`?  We can't quite implement it "honestly"
because `SomeNat` needs to "hide" the type of the newly created dictionary,
but we don't know what the actual type is!  If `someNatVal` was built into
the language, then we could manufacture a new skolem constant,
which should behave correctly.

Since extra language constructors have additional maintenance costs,
we use a trick to implement `someNatVal` in the library.  The idea is that
instead of generating a "fresh" type for each use of `someNatVal`, we simply
use GHC's placeholder type `Any` (of kind `Nat`). So, the elaborated
version of the code is:

  someNatVal n = withSNat @T (SomeNat @T) (SNat @T n) (Proxy @T)
    where type T = Any Nat

After inlining and simplification, this ends up looking something like this:

  someNatVal n = SomeNat @T (KnownNat @T (SNat @T n)) (Proxy @T)
    where type T = Any Nat

`KnownNat` is the constructor for dictionaries for the class `KnownNat`.
See Note [withDict] in "GHC.HsToCore.Expr" for details on how
we actually construct the dictionary.

Note that using `Any Nat` is not really correct, as multilple calls to
`someNatVal` would violate coherence:

  type T = Any Nat

  x = SomeNat @T (KnownNat @T (SNat @T 1)) (Proxy @T)
  y = SomeNat @T (KnownNat @T (SNat @T 2)) (Proxy @T)

Note that now the code has two dictionaries with the same type, `KnownNat Any`,
but they have different implementations, namely `SNat 1` and `SNat 2`.  This
is not good, as GHC assumes coherence, and it is free to interchange
dictionaries of the same type, but in this case this would produce an incorrect
result.   See #16586 for examples of this happening.

We can avoid this problem by making the definition of `someNatVal` opaque
and we do this by using a `NOINLINE` pragma.  This restores coherence, because
GHC can only inspect the result of `someNatVal` by pattern matching on the
existential, which would generate a new type.  This restores correctness,
at the cost of having a little more allocation for the `SomeNat` constructors.
