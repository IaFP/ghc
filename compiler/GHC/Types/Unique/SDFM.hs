data Shared key ele

  | Entry !ele

-- | A 'UniqDFM' whose domain is /sets/ of 'Unique's, each of which share a
-- common value of type @ele@.
-- Every such set (\"equivalence class\") has a distinct representative
-- 'Unique'. Supports merging the entries of multiple such sets in a union-find
-- like fashion.
--
-- An accurate model is that of @[(Set key, Maybe ele)]@: A finite mapping from
-- sets of @key@s to possibly absent entries @ele@, where the sets don't overlap.
-- Example:
-- @
--   m = [({u1,u3}, Just ele1), ({u2}, Just ele2), ({u4,u7}, Nothing)]
-- @
-- On this model we support the following main operations:
--
--   * @'lookupUSDFM' m u3 == Just ele1@, @'lookupUSDFM' m u4 == Nothing@,
--     @'lookupUSDFM' m u5 == Nothing@.
--   * @'equateUSDFM' m u1 u3@ is a no-op, but
--     @'equateUSDFM' m u1 u2@ merges @{u1,u3}@ and @{u2}@ to point to
--     @Just ele2@ and returns the old entry of @{u1,u3}@, @Just ele1@.
--   * @'addToUSDFM' m u3 ele4@ sets the entry of @{u1,u3}@ to @Just ele4@.
--
-- As well as a few means for traversal/conversion to list.
