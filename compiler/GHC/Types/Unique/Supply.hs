{- Note [How the unique supply works]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The basic idea (due to Lennart Augustsson) is that a UniqSupply is
lazily-evaluated infinite tree.

* At each MkSplitUniqSupply node is a unique Int, and two
  sub-trees (see data UniqSupply)

* takeUniqFromSupply :: UniqSupply -> (Unique, UniqSupply)
  returns the unique Int and one of the sub-trees

* splitUniqSupply :: UniqSupply -> (UniqSupply, UniqSupply)
  returns the two sub-trees

* When you poke on one of the thunks, it does a foreign call
  to get a fresh Int from a thread-safe counter, and returns
  a fresh MkSplitUniqSupply node.  This has to be as efficient
  as possible: it should allocate only
     * The fresh node
     * A thunk for each sub-tree

Note [How unique supplies are used]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The general design (used throughout GHC) is to:

* For creating new uniques either a UniqSupply is used and threaded through
  or for monadic code a MonadUnique instance might conjure up uniques using
  `uniqFromMask`.
* Different parts of the compiler will use a UniqSupply or MonadUnique instance
  with a specific mask. This way the different parts of the compiler will
  generate uniques with different masks.

If different code shares the same mask then care has to be taken that all uniques
still get distinct numbers. Usually this is done by relying on genSym which
has *one* counter per GHC invocation that is relied on by all calls to it.
But using something like the address for pinned objects works as well and in fact is done
for fast strings.

This is important for example in the simplifier. Most passes of the simplifier use
the same mask 's'. However in some places we create a unique supply using `mkSplitUniqSupply`
and thread it through the code, while in GHC.Core.Opt.Simplify.Monad  we use the
`instance MonadUnique SimplM`, which uses `mkSplitUniqSupply` in getUniqueSupplyM
and `uniqFromMask` in getUniqeM.

Ultimately all these boil down to each new unique consisting of the mask and the result from
a call to `genSym`. The later producing a distinct number for each invocation ensuring
uniques are distinct.

Note [Optimising the unique supply]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The inner loop of mkSplitUniqSupply is a function closure

     mk_supply s0 =
        case noDuplicate# s0 of { s1 ->
        case unIO genSym s1 of { (# s2, u #) ->
        case unIO (unsafeDupableInterleaveIO (IO mk_supply)) s2 of { (# s3, x #) ->
        case unIO (unsafeDupableInterleaveIO (IO mk_supply)) s3 of { (# s4, y #) ->
        (# s4, MkSplitUniqSupply (mask .|. u) x y #)
        }}}}

It's a classic example of an IO action that is captured and then called
repeatedly (see #18238 for some discussion). It mustn't allocate!  The test
perf/should_run/UniqLoop keeps track of this loop.  Watch it carefully.

We used to write it as:

     mk_supply :: IO UniqSupply
     mk_supply = unsafeInterleaveIO $
                 genSym      >>= \ u ->
                 mk_supply   >>= \ s1 ->
                 mk_supply   >>= \ s2 ->
                 return (MkSplitUniqSupply (mask .|. u) s1 s2)

and to rely on -fno-state-hack, full laziness and inlining to get the same
result. It was very brittle and required enabling -fno-state-hack globally. So
it has been rewritten using lower level constructs to explicitly state what we
want.

Note [Optimising use of unique supplies]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When it comes to having a way to generate new Uniques
there are generally three ways to deal with this:

For pure code the only good approach is to take an UniqSupply
as argument. Then  thread it through the code splitting it
for sub-passes or when creating uniques.
The code for this is about as optimized as it gets, but we can't
get around the need to allocate one `UniqSupply` for each Unique
we need.

For code in IO we can improve on this by threading only the *mask*
we are going to use for Uniques. Using `uniqFromMask` to
generate uniques as needed. This gets rid of the overhead of
allocating a new UniqSupply for each unique generated. It also avoids
frequent state updates when the Unique/Mask is part of the state in a
state monad.

For monadic code in IO which always uses the same mask we can go further
and hardcode the mask into the MonadUnique instance. On top of all the
benefits of threading the mask this *also* has the benefit of avoiding
the mask getting captured in thunks, or being passed around at runtime.
It does however come at the cost of having to use a fixed Mask for all
code run in this Monad. But rememeber, the Mask is purely cosmetic:
See Note [Uniques and masks].

NB: It's *not* an optimization to pass around the UniqSupply inside an
IORef instead of the mask. While this would avoid frequent state updates
it still requires allocating one UniqSupply per Unique. On top of some
overhead for reading/writing to/from the IORef.

All of this hinges on the assumption that UniqSupply and
uniqFromMask use the same source of distinct numbers (`genSym`) which
allows both to be used at the same time, with the same mask, while still
ensuring distinct uniques.
One might consider this fact to be an "accident". But GHC worked like this
as far back as source control history goes. It also allows the later two
optimizations to be used. So it seems safe to depend on this fact.
